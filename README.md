# Google_Stock_Price_Prediction
A Deep Learning RNN Model which uses Stacked LSTM to predict the upcoming trend of Google Stock prices based on what it has learned.

Google Stock Prices Dataset (2005-2021) is provided by Kaggle and is divided into two sub-dataset i.e, "Google_Stock_Price_Train.csv" (training dataset) and "Google_Stock_Price_Test.csv" (testing dataset).

The training dataset is analysed and get learned by Stacked LSTM algorithm to predict the Google Stock Price pattern for test dataset.

Tools Used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Keras.
